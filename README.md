Notice on Code Availability of IDBT:

Thank you for your interest in our paper:
“Interactive Dual-Branch Transformer for Precise Agricultural Parcel Delineation from Remote Sensing Imagery”
(Remote Sensing, 2025, https://doi.org/10.3390/rs17223664)

At this stage, only the model files have been uploaded.
The complete source code, including the full framework, training scripts, and data processing pipeline, will be released soon.

The full release is temporarily delayed because it requires internal approval and code anonymization/cleanup to comply with institutional regulations. I am currently working on these steps, and the complete repository will be updated as soon as the process is finished.

Thank you for your patience and understanding.
If you have any questions in the meantime, feel free to open an issue.
